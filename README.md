# Sales-Dashboard

I am very excited to share a project that I have currently Completed in Excel. The name of my project is "Sales Dashboard" The main objective of this project is to create a Sales dashboard using Excel to analyze Category wise sales, Total no of profits gained, state-wise sales, total no of customer counts, monthly sales, and top 5 customers who are making a profit.

To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.

âœ… Understanding the dataset.

âœ… Then I checked whether the data sets contain null values or duplicate values and cleaned it.

âœ… Convert the sales, profit & Quantity columns data into number.

âœ… Add two more columns in this data set i.e. Year and Month that are extracted from the Order date column with the help of the Year and Month formula in Excel.

âœ… Created Pivot tables, Charts, and Graphs ðŸ“Š to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand and also insert map.

âœ… Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with inserting slicers that allow users to interact with the data.

Key insights :

âœ… If we analyze Category wise sales data, Phones are the highest number of sales.

âœ… Yearly profits are gained in the technology & office supply category.

âœ… The States which have the maximum Number of Sales in California

âœ… The highest number of sales happened in the month of November

âœ… Tamara Chand is the customer who makes the highest profits.

âœ… Maximum number of customer count increase in the year 2017.
